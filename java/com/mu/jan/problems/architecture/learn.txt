Clean architecture is a way to manage complexity of android projects.
There are three main layers of clean architecture in android:
1. Data Layer - database, api, local or remote data source work
2. Domain layer - consists models, repository, viewModels
3. Presentation layer - consists activities, fragments, service, broadcast receivers,
adapters, and all of UI related code.
